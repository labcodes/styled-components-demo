# React Styled-Components Demo

## Overview

This project is a simple React application demonstrating the use of styled-components for styling React components.

The project is set up with TypeScript and showcases the integration of styled-components in a TypeScript-based React application.

## Key Features

- **React with TypeScript**: The project is bootstrapped with Create React App with TypeScript template.
- **Styled-Components**: We use styled-components for styling the React components, providing a more dynamic and powerful styling solution compared to traditional CSS.
